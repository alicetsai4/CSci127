### Living in East Harlem: A Brief Analysis

What makes a neighborhood a desirable place to live? There are many factors that must be taken into consideration, but 3 of the most important qualities are:  
1. Safety
2. Affordability
3. Location  
Let's take a look at how East Harlem fares on these 3 criteria.  

**_Safety_**
East Harlem is not the safest neighborhood, with an overall safety ranking of 44th out of the 69 listed neighborhoods in NYC and 8th out of the 17 listed neighborhoods in Manhattan according to DNA Info's Crime & Safety Report. However, overall crime rates have dropped 70% from 1993 to 2010, with 86% and 81% decreases in car theft and burglaries, respectively, and rates of these property crimes are still much lower than the national average currently. While murder rates in East Harlem are also below the national average, rates of assault are well above the national average and the neighborhood is NYC’s 6th least safe area for rape.  

**_Affordability_**
Cost of living in East Harlem is somewhat high compared to the rest of the country. The median home value is $936,528 and the median rent is $1,037, which are both higher than the national median. However, compared to other neighborhoods in Manhattan, the cost of living in East Harlem is on the less expensive side, with a noticeably lower monthly rent than the other three Manhattan neighborhoods my group explored — East Village, Chinatown, and West Village.  

**_Location_**
East Harlem is in a relatively convenient location, offering many bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and parks for residents to enjoy. Many young professionals live in East Harlem, and the neighborhood has excellent nightlife and diversity. In terms of transportation, residents have access to the 6 train, the Metro North, and the M1, M101, M102, M103, M15, M2, and M98 buses. The average commute to work is 36 minutes. Given the lack of access to more subway lines, the location isn't exactly ideal, but it is certainly not bad either, especially considering how much more affordable it is compared to other Manhattan neighborhoods.
